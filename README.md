CONNECT FOUR PROJECT

## Overview

The objective of the game is to connect four similar dots. It requires 2 players. Each player is assigned a different dot. The first player to connect four dots wins. If the board is filled without either player connecting 4 dots, it is a draw. Scores are kept in three categories: win, lost, draw. The UI consists of a table where the players can click to add their dots. The dots will be either a cross or a circle to clearly distinguish the players. After each win or draw, players are able to start new game.
